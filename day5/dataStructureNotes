Data Structures
-There is no one best structure. 
--Working with map/location data: use a graph to quickly find the points. 
-If you need an ordered list with FAST inserts/removals at the beginning and end the you should use a Linked List. 
-Web scraping nested HTML. Looking to gather information from other websites, you should use a tree!
-Need to write a scheduler? Write a binary heap! 

They all excel for different reasons! 

ES2015 Class Syntax:
-What is a class:
    A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods.

-The method to create new objects MUST be called constructor. 
    Whenever a new student is create these two properties are created for that student. Additionally, the class keyword creates a constant, so you can NOT redefine it.

Syntax for Class: {This DOES NOT create any students, just a blue print for what the students will have.} 
class Student //Needs to be capital first letter. {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    someInstanceMethod(){
        //What should each object created from this class should be able to do? More indiviualized.             //To call you would use firstStudent.someInstanceMethod()
    }
    static someStaticMethod(){
        //Acts as a utility/helper method for all objects.       //To call this you have to use Student.someStaticMethod(firstStudent, secondStudent)
    }
}
//This class defines a pattern.

class Tree {        //Again just a pattern.

}

Creating objects from Classes
-Use the new keyword. 
                        //Student is the class we are referencing. 
let firstStudent = new Student('Colt', 'Steele');       //This creates a new Student object using the Student class blueprint we created. 
let secondStudent = new Student('Matthew', 'Macon');

-the word 'this' refers to the the indiviual instance of the object that was created. 


Recap:
-Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as instances
-Classes are created with the new keyword
-The constructor function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated.
-Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects
-Class methods can be added using the static keyword.
